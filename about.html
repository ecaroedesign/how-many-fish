      <h1>The Story</h1>
        <h4>
          It all started when my puppy, Oliver, would lay on his back waiting for tummy rubs. Oliver loved any sort of tickles or scratches, but he especially loved belly rubs. Oliver was a long-haired chihuahua, and he was quite large for his breed (oops). Whenever he would lay there, we would put our hand on his stomach and say "Oh Olive, you've got 4 fish in there!." Every day we would feel his tummy and tell him how many fish he had swimming around. Sometimes, he'd have a baby shark in there, but that wasn't often.
        </h4>

        <h4>
          Unfortunately, Oliver passed in June 2021 due to cancer. Now we are left with a grumpy, fat cat called Fred who HATES his stomach being touched. We don't count his fish often. However, Fred enjoys watching Cat TV. He loves the aquarium channel in particular.
